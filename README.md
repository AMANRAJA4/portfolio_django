Django Portfolio Website 

This is a personal portfolio website built with Django as the backend server and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend design. The unique feature of this portfolio is that it supports dynamic data management through Django's built-in admin panel. This allows you to easily update your profile information, portfolio projects, education details, social links, and other content directly from the database, without modifying the code.

Features
Dynamic Content Management: Update profile details (profile image, name, designation, about, social links) directly from the Django admin panel.
Projects Section: Add, edit, or delete project entries with descriptions, links, and other project-specific details.
Education Section: Manage education-related details like school/college names, degrees, years, and descriptions.
Social Links: Update social media links (LinkedIn, GitHub, etc.) through the admin panel.
Fully Responsive Design: Ensures the website is accessible and visually appealing on all device sizes.
Technologies Used
Backend: Django (Python)
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
